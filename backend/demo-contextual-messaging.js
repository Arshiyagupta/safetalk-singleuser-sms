📊 ENHANCEMENT IMPACT:

❌ BEFORE (Without Context):
"Hey Sarah, Michael is requesting a schedule change. Send 1, 2, or 3?"

✅ AFTER (With Context):
"Hey Sarah, Michael is asking for earlier pickup because he has a work meeting. Send 1, 2, or 3?"

🎯 KEY BENEFITS:
• Client understands WHY ex is making the request
• More empathetic and informed responses
• Reduces assumption and conflict
• Provides helpful context for better decision-making
• Shows the ex's reasoning isn't just being difficult

🧠 CONTEXT TYPES DETECTED:
• Work obligations (meetings, running late)
• Medical appointments & emergencies  
• Travel & flights
• School events & activities
• Family emergencies
• Transportation issues

📈 RESULT: More understanding and cooperative co-parenting communication!
